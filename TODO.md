# TODO - SQLite Syntax Error Fix

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] **Fixed SQLite syntax error in getActivityTimesForRoute method**
  - Changed `orderBy: 'created_at ASC AND id ASC'` to `orderBy: 'created_at ASC, id ASC'` in `lib/widget/sqflitehelper.dart`
  - This resolves the "near 'AND': syntax error" that was occurring when fetching activity times for routes

## Summary
The SQLite syntax error has been successfully resolved. The issue was in the ORDER BY clause where "AND" was incorrectly used instead of a comma to separate multiple columns. This fix will allow the database query to execute properly without throwing syntax errors.

The error was occurring in the `getActivityTimesForRoute` method when trying to fetch activity data for students on specific routes. The corrected SQL query will now properly order results by both `created_at` (ascending) and `id` (ascending) columns.
